1) Installation
---------------

As Symfony and PayumBundle uses [Composer][4] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Symfony application:

    php composer.phar create-project payum/payum-bundle-sandbox path/to/install --stability=dev

Composer will install Symfony and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.

2) Checking your System Configuration
-------------------------------------

Before starting coding, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for Symfony.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php

Access the `config.php` script from a browser:

    http://localhost/path/to/symfony/app/web/config.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.

**Warning:**

> Don't forget to configure a payment gateway options in `app/config/parameters.yml`.
 
3) Browsing the Demo Application
--------------------------------
        
Congratulations! You're now ready to use Symfony.

From the `config.php` page, click the "Bypass configuration and go to the
Welcome page" link to load up your first Symfony page.

You can also use a web-based configurator by clicking on the "Configure your
Symfony Application online" link of the `config.php` page.
